    <h1>Crash 4: Its about Time</h1>
     
     <h2>Gamepkay</h2>
     <p>Players take control of the characters of Crash and Coco Bandicoot in order to traverse levels and reach the goal of the stage</p>
     <p>Traditional elements of the series return, including various traps and obstacles to overcome, enemies that can be defeated in certain manners (such as jumping on them), and boxes that can be smashed open for items, some of which act as checkpoints that players restart at when their character dies.</p>
